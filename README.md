# Charry Data Structure

## 0. Overview
Charry Data Structure is a repository that stores some useful data structures.
I use go programming language to implement these data structures due to three
advantages it has. First, go is a compiled language, which means it is faster
than many interpreted languages such as python. Second, it is very easy for
developers to design tests for their code. I love go test! Third, go is a
very widely used language right now, especially when it comes to cloud.
